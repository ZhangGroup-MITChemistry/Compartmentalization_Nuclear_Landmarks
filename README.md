# Nuclear Landmarks	

LAMMPS input files and source codes to execute chromatin simulations in the presence of lamina, nucleolus and speckles. The cell type being used is HFF combined with the 
SPIN state analysis carried out for the same cell type. 

- Types 1-4 are chromatin
- Type 5 is nucleolus 
- Type 6 is lamina 
- Type 7 is speckles
